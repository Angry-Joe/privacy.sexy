# Application

Application layer is mainly responsible for:

- creating an event-based and mutable [application state](#application-state),
- [loading (parsing and compiling)](#loading-parsing-and-compiling) the [application data](#application-data).

ðŸ“– Refer to [architecture.md | Layered Application](./architecture.md#layered-application) to read more about the layered architecture.

## Structure

Application layer code exists in [`/src/application`](./../src/application/) and includes following structure:

- [**`collections/`**](./../src/application/collections/): Holds [collection files](./collection-files.md).
- [**`Common/`**](./../src/application/Common/): Contains common functionality in application layer.
- `...`: rest of the application layer source code organized using folders-by-feature structure.

## Application state

It uses [state pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern) with context and state objects. [`ApplicationContext.ts`](./../src/application/Context/ApplicationContext.ts) the "Context" of state pattern provides an instance of [`CategoryCollectionState.ts`](./../src/application/Context/State/CategoryCollectionState.ts) (the "State" of the state pattern) for every supported collection.

Presentation layer uses a singleton (same instance of) [`ApplicationContext.ts`](./../src/application/Context/ApplicationContext.ts) throughout the application to ensure consistent state.

ðŸ“– Refer to [architecture.md | Application State](./architecture.md#application-state) to get an overview of event handling and [presentation.md | Application State](./presentation.md#application-state) for deeper look into how the presentation layer manages state.

## Application data

Application data is collection files using YAML. You can refer to [collection-files.md](./collection-files.md) to read more about the scheme and structure of application data files. You can also check the source code [collection yaml files](./../src/application/collections/) to directly see the application data using that scheme.

Application layer [loads](#loading-parsing-and-compiling) application data into [`Application`](./../src/domain/Application/Application.ts)). Once parsed, application layer provides the necessary functionality to presentation layer based on the application data. You can read more about how presentation layer consumes the application data in [presentation.md | Application Data](./presentation.md#application-data).

Application layer enables [data-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven_programming) by leveraging the data to the rest of the source code. It makes it easy for community to contribute on the project by using a declarative language used in collection files.

### Loading (parsing and compiling)

Application layer:

1. Loads the [application data](#application-data).
2. Compiles the application data, including parsing.
   This compiler implementation is simple and **single-pass**, meaning that it
   interleaves **parsing** with some **compilation** tasks.
3. Provides the domain object [`Application.ts`](./../src/domain/Application/Application.ts).

This happens through following abstractions:

- [`ApplicationProvider.ts`](./../src/application/Application/ApplicationProvider.ts): Provides singleton application object (data/state) to rest of the application.
- Loading modules:
  - `ApplicationLoader.ts`: Orchestrates constructing/loading Application object.
  - `ProjectDetailsLoader.ts`: Provides metadata about the application that's not related to any of the collections.
  - `CollectionsProvider.ts`: Loads, parses and compiles the collection data.
    - The build tool loads (or injects) application data ([collection yaml files](./../src/application/collections/)) into the application layer in compile time.
    - It uses [`CollectionCompiler`](./../src/application/Application/Loader/Collections/Compiler/CollectionCompiler.ts) to compile the application:
      - It compiles templating syntax during parsing to create the end scripts.
      - Read more:
        - Templating syntax in [templating.md](./templating.md)
        - How application data uses them through functions in [collection-files.md | Function](./collection-files.md#function).
      - The steps to extend the templating syntax:
        1. Add a new parser under [SyntaxParsers](./../src/application/Application/Loader/Collections/Compiler/Executable/Script/Compiler/Expressions/SyntaxParsers) where you can look at other parsers to understand more.
        2. Register your in [CompositeExpressionParser](./../src/application/Application/Loader/Collections/Compiler/Executable/Script/Compiler/Expressions/Parser/CompositeExpressionParser.ts).
